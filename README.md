## What is False Position Method?
False Position Method, also known as Regula Falsi, is a numerical method for finding the roots of a function. This method uses iterative approximation techniques.

In this code, we've utilized a simple polynomial function, like **$x^2 - x - 1$**, as an example. We've specifically chosen this basic function because it's crucial to know that such a function always has a root. If, however, the function doesn't have a root, the program will notify us accordingly. If you're uncertain whether a function has a root or not, you can refer to the **Intermediate Value Theorem** for guidance.
