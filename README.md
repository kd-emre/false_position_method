## What is False Position Method?
False Position Method, also known as Regula Falsi, is a numerical method for finding the roots of a function. This method uses iterative approximation techniques.

In this code we use polynomial function example such as **$x^2 - x - 1$** . We choose this basic function because of you have to know that that function had a root, if it not program says to us **there is no root.**
